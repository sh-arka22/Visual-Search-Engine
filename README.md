# Image Search Engine

This project is an image search engine that allows users to upload an image and find similar images from a preloaded database. It uses the ResNet50 model for feature extraction and cosine similarity for finding similar images.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image in JPG format.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features from the uploaded image using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
- **Similarity Search**: Finds similar images from the database using cosine similarity.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Users can adjust the similarity threshold and the number of similar images to display.
- **Caching**: Utilizes Streamlit's caching for improved performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nasirovsh/ecommerce-visual-search.git
    cd ecommerce-visual-search
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   For better performance, install the Watchdog module:
      
      For macOS users:
      ```sh
      xcode-select --install
      pip install watchdog
      ```
      For Windows users:
      ```sh
      pip install watchdog
      ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the image database**:
   - Place your database images in the `db/` directory.
   - Ensure all images are in JPG format.

2. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   
   - Run in terminal:
      ```sh
      streamlit run main.py
      ```
   
   - Run/Debug in PyCharm:
   
      Go to Run/Debug Configurations and add a new configuration for Streamlit Server. Set module name to `streamlit` and parameters to `run main.py`.
   
      Click on the Run button to start the Streamlit server.

   - Open the browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. **Use the app**:
   - Upload an image: Use the file uploader to select an image in JPG format.
   - Adjust parameters: Use the sliders to set the similarity threshold and the number of similar images to display.
   - Find similar images: Click the "Find Similar Images" button to search for similar images in the database.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the Streamlit app.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- `db/`: Directory containing the image database.
- `README.md`: This file, containing project documentation.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.

## Dependencies

- `pillow == 10.3.0`: Python Imaging Library for opening, manipulating, and saving images.
- `tensorflow == 2.16.1`: Open-source machine learning framework used for the ResNet50 model.
- `streamlit == 1.37.1`: Framework for building interactive web applications.
- `scikit-learn == 1.5.1`: Machine learning library used for cosine similarity calculation.
- `certifi == 2024.7.4`: Provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root Certificates.

## How It Works

1. The app loads a pre-trained ResNet50 model on startup.
2. When a user uploads an image, the app extracts features using the ResNet50 model.
3. These features are compared to the pre-extracted features of images in the database using cosine similarity.
4. The app displays the most similar images based on the user-defined threshold and number of results.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter memory issues, try reducing the number of images in your database or upgrading your hardware.
- Ensure your uploaded images are in JPG format and are not corrupted.
- If the app is slow, it might be due to the initial loading of the database. Subsequent runs should be faster due to caching.
